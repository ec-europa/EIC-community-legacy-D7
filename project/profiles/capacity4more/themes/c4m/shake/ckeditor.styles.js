// This file contains style definitions that can be used by CKEditor plugins.
//
// The most common use for it is the "stylescombo" plugin, which shows a combo
// in the editor toolbar, containing all styles. Other plugins instead, like
// the div plugin, use a subset of the styles on their feature.
//
// If you don't have plugins that depend on this file, you can simply ignore it.
// Otherwise it is strongly recommended to customize this file to match your
// website requirements and design properly.
